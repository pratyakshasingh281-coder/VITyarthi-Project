 Student Performance Visualization Tool

A tool that accepts students’ assessment records and visually compares their performance over time.

Problem Statement

Educational institutions often maintain large amounts of student assessment data, but teachers and students rarely get clear visual insights into performance trends. Traditional report cards show marks but fail to represent improvement, decline, or consistency over time.
Hence, there is a need for a simple, interactive tool that can intake assessment records and automatically generate visual comparisons of student performance across different tests and subjects.
Scope of the Project

This project focuses on:

Building a system that accepts assessment data (CSV, manual input, or form-based entry).

Generating visual charts (line charts, bar graphs, radar charts, etc.) to show performance trends.

Allowing users to compare multiple assessments, subjects, or students.

Presenting insights that help teachers, parents, and students understand academic progress quickly.

Out of scope:

Automated grading or evaluation.
Predictive analytics using ML .
Integration with external school ERP systems.

Target Users
Teachers – to analyse class progress and identify weak/strong areas.
Students – to track their own improvement across tests.
Parents – to understand overall academic trends of their child.
School Administrators – to monitor performance patterns across classes.
