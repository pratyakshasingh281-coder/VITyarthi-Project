Overview of the Project

This project is a simple and interactive Python tool that allows users to compare the performance trends of two students across multiple assessments.
By entering the assessment names and the scores for both students, the tool generates a line graph visualizing their performance side-by-side.

It helps users understand:
	•	Who performed better in each assessment
	•	How each student’s performance changed over time
	•	Overall academic trends in a clear and visual format

This tool is especially useful for students, teachers, and parents who want quick performance insights without manual graph plotting.
